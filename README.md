### Hi there 👋


- 🔭 Take a look at my Pinned Projects
- 🌱 I used to use `Neovim + Tmux`. But after 5 years of using Vim, moved to `Zed + Aerospace`. Really enjoying my setup. I work on MacOS for work with a Ubuntu ARM VM for development using Orb Stack. Check out my configs in [aincrad](https://github.com/msharran/aincrad). Also, my VM setup installation is as simple as `cd ansible && make orb/create && make orb/install`.
- ⚡ I wrote a highly performant lite [redis server in Zig](https://github.com/msharran/codingchallenges.fyi/tree/main/redis-server/zig-redis-server) in Zig
- 📫 I enjoy systems and network programming, So I solve problems posted in [CodingChallenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi) and [ProtoHackers](https://protohackers.com) as a Hobby during weekends.
- Very rarely I had contributed to OSS, checkout my commit graph.
